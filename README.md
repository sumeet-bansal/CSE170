## Triton Meal Planner

### POV
As UCSD students who spend the bulk of our time on-campus, it can be difficult to plan meals since our options are severely limited to HDH's offerings. And even though HDH posts nutritional information for its food items on its website, it is a difficult and tedious process to construct a full meal plan or even planning for a single meal since it involves navigating multiple links before finally settling on something.

### User Base
Since this web-app is very HDH-specific, the main user base will be UCSD students with dining plans, although it extends to anyone who is on-campus and relies on HDH for food during the day. Although this is fairly restricted, we believe that a simple and specialized site for a smaller target audience would be much more popular and impactful than a more general website that could easily get buried by better existing alternatives for regular meal planning, especially since nothing of the sort exists for regular UCSD students who may rely on HDH.

### Core Interaction
The basic idea is that users (UCSD students) can input meal preferences (e.g. "vegetarian" within "Muir + Revelle + Marshall", "2" meals under "1500" calories and "12" dollars). From these preferences, the mobile web-app formulates a meal plan for the day (e.g. "a Goody's breakfast burrito" + "a taco salad from Pines' Cantina").

### Alignment with Studio Brief (Automation)
As explained in the POV, constructing a meal plan (or even planning for a single meal) is a difficult and tedious process that involves navigating through multiple links on the HDH website before finally settling on something. This web-app automates the process of navigating through the HDH website and creating a meal plan that fits the given parameters (price point, dietary/caloric restrictions, location preferences, etc.) to save users time daily. The core interaction itself is an automation of this process since it only involves setting preferences as opposed to keeping these preferences in mind and manually attempting to create combinations of meals that fit the given parameters.
